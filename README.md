# analytic-scalar-charges

The project focuses on deriving scalar charges of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories analytically. This repository provides final expressions of scalar charges.

scalar_charges.mx stores lengthy expressions for analytic scalar charges (or some coefficients that are needed for analytic expressions with spontaneous scalarization) in the Tolman VII model and for constant density stars. You can save this file in the same directory as scalar_charges.nb and run the latter. The latter Mathematica notebook also contains examples of estimating the scalar charge values and show example plots of the scalar charge.
